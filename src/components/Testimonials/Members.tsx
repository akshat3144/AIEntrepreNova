    comment: `Being in ACM has been the most delightful experience of my entire college journey. In August 2023, I unexpectedly became the content head of MU-ACM. The club, the people, and the work quickly became an integral part of my life. I'm so grateful for the opportunity. I gave my all to the organization and was honored to become president. My tenure in both positions has been a total of two years, but the infinite memories will last a lifetime. Here at MU-ACM, we're not just colleagues; we're a family. We're proud to showcase that feeling of camaraderie in our chapter's culture.`,
